Better Spotify desktop integration for linux
--------------------------------------------

Introduction
============

Goal of this project is to provide extensive desktop integration possibilities
for Spotify_ (R) Linux client. At it's current state Spotify Linux preview client
available for premium subscriber does not integrate to the common Linux desktop
user experiense as well as the usual music players. The basic features like
media key bindings and song information notifications stand as the inspiration
for this project, but other possibilities are only limited by the API provided
by Spotify client and our imagination.
